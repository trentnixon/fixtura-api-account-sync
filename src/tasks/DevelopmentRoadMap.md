# Development Roadmap – Task Processing

This file tracks **progress, priorities, and recommendations** for the task processing modules. It should remain **clean and high-level**, while detailed planning lives in `Tickets.md`.

---

## ✅ Completed

- [x] Base task processor with common functionality
- [x] Association task processor
- [x] Club task processor
- [x] On-demand account update processor
- [x] Direct club ID task processor
- [x] Direct association ID task processor

## ⏳ To Do (easy → hard)

1. [ ] **Task Processing Enhancements**
   - Add task retry mechanisms
   - Implement task result caching
   - Add task performance monitoring
   - (see TKT-2025-XXX for details)

2. [ ] **Error Handling Improvements**
   - Enhance task error handling
   - Add error recovery mechanisms
   - Implement error alerting
   - (see TKT-2025-XXX for details)

3. [ ] **Performance Optimization**
   - Optimize task processing operations
   - Implement parallel task processing
   - Add task batching
   - (see TKT-2025-XXX for details)

4. [ ] **Task Management**
   - Add task prioritization
   - Implement task scheduling
   - Add task cancellation support
   - (see TKT-2025-XXX for details)

## 💡 Recommendations

- Consider implementing a task factory pattern
- Add comprehensive unit tests for all task processors
- Implement task performance metrics and analytics
- Add support for task configuration presets
- Consider adding task history and audit logging
- Add comprehensive API documentation for task operations

### Example Usage

* Mark off items as they are completed.
* Reorder tasks so easier jobs always appear first.
* Update when scope changes or new requirements arise.
* Cross-reference each task with its ticket for detailed breakdowns and discussions.
