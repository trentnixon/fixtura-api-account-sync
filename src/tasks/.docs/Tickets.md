# 📁 Tickets.md – Task Processing

This file is used for **feature-level planning and tracking** for task processing operations.
Each ticket must follow a consistent structure so it can be easily read by both humans and LLMs.

#### Overview
Add retry mechanisms, result caching, and performance monitoring to task processors.

#### What We Need to Do
Improve task reliability and performance through retries, caching, and monitoring.

#### Phases & Tasks

### Phase 1: Retry Mechanisms
#### Tasks
- [ ] Design retry strategy for failed tasks
- [ ] Implement retry logic with exponential backoff
- [ ] Add retry configuration and limits
- [ ] Create retry testing scenarios

### Phase 2: Result Caching
#### Tasks
- [ ] Design task result caching strategy
- [ ] Implement caching layer for task results
- [ ] Add cache invalidation mechanisms
- [ ] Create cache performance monitoring

### Phase 3: Performance Monitoring
#### Tasks
- [ ] Add task performance metrics collection
- [ ] Implement performance monitoring
- [ ] Add performance analytics
- [ ] Create performance dashboard

#### Constraints, Risks, Assumptions
- Constraints: Caching must not cause stale data issues
- Risks: Retry mechanisms may cause duplicate processing
- Assumptions: Most task failures are transient
