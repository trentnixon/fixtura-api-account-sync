#### Overview
Enhance configuration management with validation, hot-reloading, and versioning.

#### What We Need to Do
Improve configuration robustness and flexibility through validation, hot-reloading, and versioning.

#### Phases & Tasks

### Phase 1: Configuration Validation
#### Tasks
- [ ] Design configuration validation schema
- [ ] Implement validation for all configuration modules
- [ ] Add validation error reporting
- [ ] Create validation testing

### Phase 2: Hot-Reloading
#### Tasks
- [ ] Design hot-reload mechanism
- [ ] Implement configuration change detection
- [ ] Add reload handlers for different config types
- [ ] Create hot-reload testing

### Phase 3: Versioning
#### Tasks
- [ ] Design configuration versioning system
- [ ] Implement version tracking
- [ ] Add version migration utilities
- [ ] Create versioning documentation

#### Constraints, Risks, Assumptions
- Constraints: Hot-reloading must not break running operations
- Risks: Configuration changes may cause service instability
- Assumptions: Most configuration changes are infrequent
