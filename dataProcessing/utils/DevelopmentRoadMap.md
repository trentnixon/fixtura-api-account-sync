# Development Roadmap – Data Processing Utilities

This file tracks **progress, priorities, and recommendations** for the utility modules. It should remain **clean and high-level**, while detailed planning lives in `Tickets.md`.

---

## ✅ Completed

- [x] Error handling utilities for data processing
- [x] Memory usage tracking and monitoring
- [x] General processor utility functions
- [x] Database query helper functions

---

## ⏳ To Do (easy → hard)

1. [ ] **Utility Enhancements**
   - Add utility function documentation
   - Implement utility performance monitoring
   - Add utility usage analytics
   - (see TKT-2025-XXX for details)

2. [ ] **Error Handling Improvements**
   - Enhance error categorization
   - Add error recovery utilities
   - Implement error reporting utilities
   - (see TKT-2025-XXX for details)

3. [ ] **Memory Management**
   - Enhance memory tracking capabilities
   - Add memory leak detection
   - Implement memory optimization utilities
   - (see TKT-2025-XXX for details)

4. [ ] **Query Optimization**
   - Optimize database query helpers
   - Add query performance monitoring
   - Implement query caching utilities
   - (see TKT-2025-XXX for details)

5. [ ] **Advanced Features**
   - Add utility function testing framework
   - Implement utility performance profiling
   - Add utility usage tracking and analytics
   - (see TKT-2025-XXX for details)

## 💡 Recommendations

- Consider implementing utility function versioning
- Add comprehensive unit tests for all utility functions
- Implement utility function performance benchmarking
- Add support for utility function plugins
- Consider adding utility function documentation generator
- Implement utility function usage analytics
- Add comprehensive API documentation for utilities
- Consider implementing utility function dependency management

### Example Usage

* Mark off items as they are completed.
* Reorder tasks so easier jobs always appear first.
* Update when scope changes or new requirements arise.
* Cross-reference each task with its ticket for detailed breakdowns and discussions.
