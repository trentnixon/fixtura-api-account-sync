# Development Roadmap – Processing Services and Tracking System

## ✅ Completed

- [x] Singleton ProcessingTracker with comprehensive stage tracking
- [x] CRUD operations service for data management
- [x] Data service layer with processing coordination
- [x] Stage-based processing tracking (competitions, teams, games)
- [x] Error detection and counting mechanisms
- [x] Processing metrics and statistics collection
- [x] Integration with all processing modules

## ⏳ To Do (easy → hard)

1. **Service Enhancement**

   - Add comprehensive error categorization and reporting
   - Implement processing timeout handling
   - Add service health monitoring and status reporting

2. **Tracking Improvements**

   - Add real-time processing status updates
   - Implement detailed progress reporting with percentages
   - Add processing performance metrics and analytics

3. **Data Service Optimization**

   - Optimize database operations and queries
   - Implement data caching strategies
   - Add data validation and integrity checks

4. **Integration Enhancements**

   - Improve coordination between different processing stages
   - Add proper error propagation and handling
   - Implement rollback mechanisms for failed operations

5. **Advanced Features**

   - Add support for parallel processing stages
   - Implement processing queue management
   - Add processing history and audit logging

6. **Monitoring and Observability**
   - Add comprehensive logging and monitoring
   - Implement alerting for processing failures
   - Add performance dashboards and reporting

## 💡 Recommendations

- Consider implementing a distributed processing architecture for scalability
- Add comprehensive unit tests for all service operations
- Implement data backup and recovery mechanisms
- Consider adding support for different processing strategies
- Add processing metrics export for external monitoring systems
- Implement graceful shutdown handling for long-running processes
- Consider adding support for processing templates and presets
- Add comprehensive documentation for service APIs and usage patterns
