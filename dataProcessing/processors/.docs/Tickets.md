#### Overview
Add configuration options, caching, and performance metrics to processors.

#### What We Need to Do
Enhance processor flexibility and performance through configuration, caching, and monitoring.

#### Phases & Tasks

### Phase 1: Configuration Options
#### Tasks
- [ ] Design processor configuration schema
- [ ] Implement configuration loading and validation
- [ ] Add configuration override mechanisms
- [ ] Create configuration documentation

### Phase 2: Result Caching
#### Tasks
- [ ] Identify cacheable processor results
- [ ] Implement caching layer for processor outputs
- [ ] Add cache invalidation strategies
- [ ] Create cache performance monitoring

### Phase 3: Performance Metrics
#### Tasks
- [ ] Add processor execution time tracking
- [ ] Implement processor resource usage monitoring
- [ ] Add processor performance analytics
- [ ] Create performance dashboard integration

#### Constraints, Risks, Assumptions
- Constraints: Caching must not cause stale data issues
- Risks: Configuration complexity may increase maintenance burden
- Assumptions: Processor operations are deterministic
