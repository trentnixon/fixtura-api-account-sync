# Development Roadmap – Data Processors

This file tracks **progress, priorities, and recommendations** for the specialized data processors. It should remain **clean and high-level**, while detailed planning lives in `Tickets.md`.

---

## ✅ Completed

- [x] Competition processor (scraping and assignment)
- [x] Team processor (scraping and assignment)
- [x] Game data processor (scraping and assignment)
- [x] Fixture validation processor (URL validity checking)
- [x] Processing tracker integration
- [x] Error handling and logging

## ⏳ To Do (easy → hard)

1. [ ] **Processor Enhancements**
   - Add processor configuration options
   - Implement processor result caching
   - Add processor performance metrics
   - (see TKT-2025-XXX for details)

2. [ ] **Validation Improvements**
   - Enhance fixture validation rules
   - Add validation result reporting
   - Implement validation retry mechanisms
   - (see TKT-2025-XXX for details)

3. [ ] **Performance Optimization**
   - Optimize processor data transformations
   - Implement parallel processing for independent operations
   - Add processor batch operations
   - (see TKT-2025-XXX for details)

4. [ ] **Error Recovery**
   - Add processor-level retry logic
   - Implement partial processing recovery
   - Add error categorization and handling
   - (see TKT-2025-XXX for details)

5. [ ] **Advanced Features**
   - Add support for custom processor plugins
   - Implement processor pipeline configuration
   - Add processor history and audit logging
   - (see TKT-2025-XXX for details)

## 💡 Recommendations

- Consider implementing a processor factory pattern for extensibility
- Add comprehensive unit tests for all processors
- Implement processor result validation and verification
- Add support for processor templates and presets
- Consider adding processor performance profiling
- Implement processor dependency management
- Add comprehensive documentation for processor APIs
- Consider implementing processor result streaming for large datasets

### Example Usage

* Mark off items as they are completed.
* Reorder tasks so easier jobs always appear first.
* Update when scope changes or new requirements arise.
* Cross-reference each task with its ticket for detailed breakdowns and discussions.
