#### Overview
Add processing control features including pause/resume, stage skipping, and configuration presets.

#### What We Need to Do
Enhance controller flexibility with processing control mechanisms and configuration options.

#### Phases & Tasks

### Phase 1: Pause/Resume
#### Tasks
- [ ] Design pause/resume state management
- [ ] Implement pause checkpoint creation
- [ ] Add resume from checkpoint functionality
- [ ] Create pause/resume testing scenarios

### Phase 2: Stage Skipping
#### Tasks
- [ ] Add stage skip configuration options
- [ ] Implement conditional stage execution
- [ ] Add skip validation and dependency checks
- [ ] Create stage skipping documentation

### Phase 3: Configuration Presets
#### Tasks
- [ ] Define processing preset configurations
- [ ] Implement preset loading and application
- [ ] Add preset validation and error handling
- [ ] Create preset management utilities

#### Constraints, Risks, Assumptions
- Constraints: Pause/resume must maintain data consistency
- Risks: Stage skipping may break dependencies
- Assumptions: Users understand processing dependencies
