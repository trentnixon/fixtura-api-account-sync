# Development Roadmap – Scraping Center

This file tracks **progress, priorities, and recommendations** for the core scraping functionality. It should remain **clean and high-level**, while detailed planning lives in `Tickets.md`.

## ✅ Completed

- [x] Competition scraping from web sources
- [x] Game data scraping and extraction
- [x] Team extraction from ladder/standings pages
- [x] Scraping utility functions and constants
- [x] Game data processing utilities

## ⏳ To Do (easy → hard)

1. [ ] **Scraping Enhancements**
   - Add scraping result caching
   - Implement scraping rate limiting
   - Add scraping retry strategies
   - (see TKT-2025-XXX for details)

2. [ ] **Utility Improvements**
   - Enhance utility function documentation
   - Add utility function testing
   - Implement utility performance optimization
   - (see TKT-2025-XXX for details)

3. [ ] **Performance Optimization**
   - Optimize scraping operations
   - Implement parallel scraping where possible
   - Add scraping batch operations
   - (see TKT-2025-XXX for details)

## 💡 Recommendations

- Consider implementing a scraping strategy pattern for extensibility
- Add comprehensive unit tests for all scraping operations
- Implement scraping result validation and verification
- Add support for scraping templates and presets
- Consider adding scraping performance profiling

### Example Usage

* Mark off items as they are completed.
* Reorder tasks so easier jobs always appear first.
* Update when scope changes or new requirements arise.
* Cross-reference each task with its ticket for detailed breakdowns and discussions.
