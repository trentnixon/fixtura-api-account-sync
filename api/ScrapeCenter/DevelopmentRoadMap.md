# Development Roadmap – Core Scraping Center

## ✅ Completed

- [x] Core competition data scraping functionality
- [x] Game data extraction and processing
- [x] Team extraction from ladder/standings pages
- [x] Scraping utility modules with constants and processing functions
- [x] Game module processing utilities
- [x] Scraping item definitions and utility functions
- [x] Integration with Puppeteer browser automation

## ⏳ To Do (easy → hard)

1. **Utility Module Enhancement**

   - Consolidate and optimize utility functions
   - Add comprehensive error handling to utility modules
   - Implement proper logging throughout utility functions

2. **Scraping Reliability Improvements**

   - Add retry mechanisms for failed scraping operations
   - Implement adaptive waiting strategies for dynamic content
   - Add page structure validation before data extraction

3. **Data Processing Optimization**

   - Optimize competition data extraction algorithms
   - Improve game data processing efficiency
   - Enhance team extraction from ladder pages

4. **Integration Enhancements**

   - Improve integration with Puppeteer modules
   - Add proper data validation before processing
   - Implement standardized data output formats

5. **Advanced Scraping Features**

   - Add support for different website structures
   - Implement intelligent content detection
   - Add scraping configuration management

6. **Performance and Monitoring**
   - Add performance monitoring for scraping operations
   - Implement scraping success rate tracking
   - Add memory usage optimization for large datasets

## 💡 Recommendations

- Consider implementing a plugin architecture for different scraping strategies
- Add comprehensive unit tests for all utility functions
- Implement data caching to reduce redundant scraping operations
- Consider adding support for different data formats and structures
- Add scraping metrics and performance monitoring
- Implement graceful degradation when websites change structure
- Consider adding support for incremental scraping updates
- Add comprehensive documentation for utility functions and their usage
