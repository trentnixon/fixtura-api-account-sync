#### Overview
Consolidate duplicate functionality, standardize interfaces, and remove deprecated code across API modules.

#### What We Need to Do
Clean up and standardize API modules to reduce duplication and improve maintainability.

#### Phases & Tasks

### Phase 1: Code Analysis
#### Tasks
- [ ] Identify duplicate functionality across modules
- [ ] Document deprecated code (e.g., DELETE_ScrapeUtils.js)
- [ ] Analyze module interfaces and patterns
- [ ] Create consolidation plan

### Phase 2: Standardization
#### Tasks
- [ ] Design standard module interface
- [ ] Create shared base classes and utilities
- [ ] Standardize error handling patterns
- [ ] Create module documentation standards

### Phase 3: Consolidation and Cleanup
#### Tasks
- [ ] Remove deprecated code
- [ ] Consolidate duplicate functionality
- [ ] Update all modules to use standard interfaces
- [ ] Update tests and documentation

#### Constraints, Risks, Assumptions
- Constraints: Must maintain backward compatibility during migration
- Risks: Consolidation may break existing functionality
- Assumptions: Most modules follow similar patterns
