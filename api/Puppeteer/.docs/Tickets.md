#### Overview
Consolidate duplicate scraping logic across Puppeteer subfolders and standardize scraping patterns.

#### What We Need to Do
Reduce duplication and standardize scraping approaches across AssociationCompetitions, AssociationDetails, ClubDetails, and NoClubAssociations.

#### Phases & Tasks

### Phase 1: Analysis
#### Tasks
- [ ] Identify duplicate scraping logic across subfolders
- [ ] Document common scraping patterns
- [ ] Analyze differences in scraping approaches
- [ ] Create consolidation plan

### Phase 2: Standardization
#### Tasks
- [ ] Design standard scraping interface
- [ ] Create shared scraping utilities
- [ ] Standardize error handling patterns
- [ ] Create scraping documentation standards

### Phase 3: Consolidation
#### Tasks
- [ ] Extract common scraping logic to shared modules
- [ ] Update all subfolders to use shared utilities
- [ ] Remove duplicate code
- [ ] Update tests and documentation

#### Constraints, Risks, Assumptions
- Constraints: Must maintain backward compatibility
- Risks: Consolidation may break existing functionality
- Assumptions: Most scraping follows similar patterns
